										<p>Hello. Thanks for the wonderful explanation. I especially appreciated the careful attention to security. Kids are playing their droplet as I type. One sys-admin question I had: how do I attach to tekkit-server’s screen session? I understand not making the tekkit-server account with a normal login account for security. But that means the account doesn’t have a ~/.screenrc file to put in  “multiuser on” and “acladd root” I’ve also tried su’ing to tekkit-server but since it’s not login-enabled, the su command doesn’t really do anything.</p>
<p>Ultimately i just want to connect to the running service to run commands. Is there some other way to connect to the minecraft service from the command line?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p>It didn’t quite work for us (something with Tekkit seems to have changed) but thank you for this! I found all the steps very clear and understood what I was doing at each step. Definitely helpful when our children are requesting custom modded servers and Realms just doesn’t cut it anymore! ^_^</p>

										<p>Hi, Melanie. Sorry there were some difficulties. My kids are still on a break from the server, so it hasn’t been tested in a little while. Feel free to note any differences you came across. Hope you and the kids have a blast!</p>

										<p>Roy,</p>
<p>Really great idea. Thank you very much for sharing.</p>
<p>Your work inspired me to automate it some more with some AngularJS:</p>

<p>And of course, it’s also a work in progress…aren’t they all….</p>

										<p>This is great, gnonai. Thanks so much for taking time to put this together. My kids have taken a break from the server, but I know I’ll be giving it a shot when they dive back in. Glad my notes were of some help. My efforts were all on-the-fly, so I know my code is a mess, and it’s not automated, but it was all in the spirit of saving money on hosting of the MC server. So thanks for improving on that. And thanks for the credit note. Best of luck with the server and script.</p>

										<p>Love this. Thanks. I am putting it together for my grandkids for Christmas and ran smack dab into my out-of-touch ignorance. When I launched Tekkit Launcher, rather than being able to set my ip, it asked for my Minecraft credentials. Well, the kids have them, but they are not yet part of the loop. I will buy mine, but want to do the right thing. My client is Windows. Do I just pay the $27 on the minecraft site and say that I want the Windows client? I really just want the user name and password that I need to log into the Tekkit server so that I can finish configuring. I just don’t want to buy the wrong thing. Any advice? Thanks. And again…Love this.</p>

										<p>Hi, Jim. Hopefully you figured things out. Sounded like you were on the right track. Just get a paid Minecraft account, and you’ll use it to log into the Technic Launcher to access your server. Good luck and hope you all were able to enjoy the server over the holidays.</p>

										<p>Yep, figured it out  They are having a blast with it and can’t believe what grandpa can do.  I told them that I learned it from a man named Roy. ;&gt;)  I turned on the white-list and everyone (read: Moms) feels a little safer.  Thanks again Roy</p>

										<p>Thanks for this great write-up – it worked perfectly and I was able to setup a similar server for my son. One correction: the technic server url: <a href="http://mirror.technicpack.net/Technic/servers/tekkit/Tekkit_Server_3.1.2.zip" rel="nofollow">http://mirror.technicpack.net/Technic/servers/tekkit/Tekkit_Server_3.1.2.zip</a></p>
<p>Also, any particular reason you chose Technic Classic instead of the default Minecraft server? thanks!</p>

										<p>Hi, robjr1. Glad it worked out. I just tested the link I have referenced for 3.1.2, and it still appears to work. I guess mileage may vary though. As for the reason we went with Technic, I don’t really know. <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🙂" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png"> The kids asked for it! I believe they wanted more customization with plugins, and other console commands.</p>
